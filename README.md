# 🚄 Virtual Train Route Planner

A real-time **Virtual Train Route Planner** built using Python and classic linked list structures.

🧭 It allows seamless **forward/backward navigation between stations**, as well as **loop route planning** using data structures.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **Doubly Linked List** for navigating:
  - Forward to the next station
  - Backward to the previous station

- 🔁 **Circular Linked List** for:
  - Looping routes (like metro circles or ring railways)

- 📋 **Add/Delete Stations** dynamically
- 🎯 **Real-time Navigation Simulation**
- 🖥️ Console-based output for station traversal

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Data Structures**:
  - **Doubly Linked List** for station-to-station travel
  - **Circular Linked List** for looping routes
